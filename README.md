# Designing Machine Learning Systems (Chip Huyen 2022)

> **NOTE**: This repo is work-in-progress, and will be updated when the paperback is officially published on June 21, 2022.<br>
> The ebook version is currently available on [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/) and [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Huyen-ebook-dp-B0B1LGL2SR/dp/B0B1LGL2SR/r).

Machine learning systems are both complex and unique. Complex because they consist of many different components and involve many different stakeholders. Unique because they're data dependent, with data varying wildly from one use case to the next. In this book, you'll learn a holistic approach to designing ML systems that are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and adaptive to changing environments and business requirements.

- [Table of contents](ToC.pdf)
- A review of basic ML concepts
- Advanced resources
- Tool recommendation for certain problems mentioned in the book
